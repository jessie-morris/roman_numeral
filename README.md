# RomanNumeral

The Kata says you should write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals: eg

     1 --> I
     10 --> X
     7 --> VII
     9 --> IX
etc.


There is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than about 3000. (The Romans themselves didnâ€™t tend to go any higher)
